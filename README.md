# Superhero Api

This Spring Boot Api intends to consume the official Marvel Api and store Superhero objects in a PostgreSQL object-relational database.
It uses CRUD operations to allow users to interact with resources through a series of endpoints listed in the controllers. 

# Lessons Learned

* Spring Boot
* Spring Hateoas to add links for more RESTful controllers
* Containerizing and Deploying to Docker Hub 
* PostgreSQL and PgAdmin Containers
* JPA annotations to map relationships between entities
* Postman to test CRUD operations 

# Areas to improve and next steps

* Batch inserting to improve performance when consuming the Marvel API
* Unit Testing 
* Customising Swagger UI for readable documentation

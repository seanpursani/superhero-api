# Superhero Api

This Spring Boot Api intends to consume the official Marvel Api and store Superhero objects in a PostgreSQL object-relational database.  

# Lessons Learned

* Spring Boot
* Spring Hateoas to add links for more RESTful controllers
* Containerizing and Deploying to Docker Hub 
* PostgreSQL and PgAdmin
* JPA to map relationships between entities
